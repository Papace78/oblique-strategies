Oblique Strategies

Developed by music producer Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, the oblique strategies are a deck of cards.

Each card in the game bears an indication that is seemingly enigmatic or open to various interpretations, such as "Honour thy error as a hidden intention." or "Examine the most embarrassing details carefully and amplify them."
They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation.

The website "https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html" randomly draws one from a set deck.


This little script crawls the website and records each card into a csv for personal use.
